If you have any trouble with running Velvet on a Mac or Sparc/Solaris, take a look within the Makefile.

You will find towards the top some indications to adjust the compilations to your needs.

For Solaris users, you may find it necessary to:
- replace src/recycleBin.c file with the one in contrib/solaris
- replace line 113 of utility.c from
	timersub(&tvNow, &tvstart, &tvDiff);
to:
	tvDiff.tv_sec = tvNow.tv_sec - tvStart.tv_sec;
	tvDiff.tv_usec = 0;
