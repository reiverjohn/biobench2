velvet0.7.56 (0.7.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Repackaged the upstream directory to remove the convenience copy

  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Added ‘include_debians_zlib.patch’ to enforce the use of
    /usr/include/zlib.h. This patch is applied using CDBS, see
    ‘debian/rules’ and ‘debian/README.source’.
  * Renamed ‘debian/reference’ ‘debian/upstream-metadata.yaml’ and
    centralised upstream-specific information there.

  * New upstream release correcting multiple bugs, changing the stats output,
    allowing optional scaffolding and multiple rounds of Pebble.

velvet0.7.31-1 (0.7.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
  * Create manpages using help2man
  * Move third-party/layout and third-party/afg_handling to examples

    the convenience of users - in /urs/share/velvet these scripts
    seem to be perfectly hidden and in /usr/share/doc/velvet might
    create users attendance
  * Added missing quilt entry in debian/rules
