-------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from a distribution "with binaries", such as 
hmmer-3.1b2-linux-intel-x86_64.tar.gz:
 uncompress:                uncompress hmmer-3.1b2-xyz.tar.gz  
 unpack:                    tar xf hmmer-3.1b2-xyz.tar
 move into new directory:   cd hmmer-3.1b2-xyz
 
The pre-compiled binaries are found in the directory ./binaries.
You may copy these into a directory of your choosing, or simply add
this directory to your $PATH variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from a source distribution, hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz:
 uncompress:                uncompress hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz  
 unpack:                    tar xf hmmer-3.1b2.tar
 move into new directory:   cd hmmer-3.1b2

HMMER is developed primarily on Linux and Mac OS/X systems. It is
tested on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. It is
written in ANSI C99 conforming to POSIX standards. It is meant to be
portable to any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99 compiler,
including all UNIX and Macintosh systems. A binary version is also
available for Windows systems with Cygwin installed (Cygwin is 
optional POSIX compatibility software).

-------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from a Subversion (SVN) working copy:

If you have checked HMMER out from its Subversion repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory:

   ln -s easel/aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4
   autoconf
   (cd easel; autoconf)
