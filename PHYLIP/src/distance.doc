     The programs FITCH, KITSCH, and NEIGHBOR are for dealing with  data  which
comes  in the form of a matrix of pairwise distances between all pairs of taxa,
such  as  amounts  of  DNA  hybridization,  immunological  distances,   genetic
distances  or  distances  based on molecular sequence data.  In analyzing these
data, distance matrix programs implicitly assume that:

     1. Each distance is measured independently from the  others:  no  item  of
data contributes to more than one distance.

     2. The distance between each pair of taxa is  drawn  from  a  distribution
with an expectation which is the sum of values (in effect amounts of evolution)
along the tree from one tip to the other.  The variance of the distribution  is
proportional to a power p of the expectation.

     These assumptions can be traced in the least squares methods  of  programs
FITCH  and  KITSCH  but it is not quite so easy to see them in operation in the
Neighbor-Joining method of NEIGHBOR, where the independence assumptions is less
obvious.

     THESE TWO ASSUMPTIONS ARE DUBIOUS IN MOST CASES: independence will not  be
expected  to be true in most kinds of data, such as genetic distances from gene
frequency data.  For genetic distance data in which pure genetic drift  without
mutation  can  be  assumed  to  be  the  mechanism of change CONTML may be more
appropriate.  However, FITCH, KITSCH, and NEIGHBOR  will  not  give  positively
misleading  results  (they will not make a statistically inconsistent estimate)
provided that additivity holds, which it will if the distance is computed  from
the  original data by a method which corrects for reversals and parallelisms in
evolution.  If additivity is not expected to hold, problems are more severe.  A
short  discussion  of  these  matters will be found in a review article of mine
(1984a).  For detailed, if sometimes irrelevant, controversy see the papers  by
Farris (1981, 1985, 1986) and myself (1986, 1988b).

     For genetic distances from gene frequencies, FITCH, KITSCH,  and  NEIGHBOR
may be appropriate if a neutral mutation model can be assumed and Nei's genetic
distance is used, or if pure drift can be assumed and  either  Cavalli-Sforza's
chord  measure  or  Reynolds,  Weir, and Cockerham's (1983) genetic distance is
used.  However, in the latter case (pure drift) CONTML should be better.

     Restriction fragment data can be treated by distance matrix methods  if  a
distance such as that of Nei and Li (1979) is used.

     For nucleic acid  sequences,  the  distances  computed  in  DNADIST  allow
correction  for  multiple  hits  (in  different  ways)  and should allow one to
analyse the data under the presumption of additivity.  In all  of  these  cases
independence will not be expected to hold.  DNA hybridization and immunological
distances may be additive and independent if transformed properly and  if  (and
only if) the standards against which each value is measured are independent.

     FITCH and the Neighbor-Joining option of NEIGHBOR fit a tree which has the
branch  lengths  unconstrained.   KITSCH  and  the UPGMA option of NEIGHBOR, by


contrast, assume that an "evolutionary clock" is valid, according to which  the
true  branch  lengths  from  the root of the tree to each tip are the same: the
expected amount of evolution in any lineage is proportional to elapsed time.

     The input format for distance data is straightforward.  The first line  of
the  input  file  contains  the number of species.  There follows species data,
starting, as with all other programs, with a species name.  The species name is
ten  characters  long, and must be padded out with blanks if shorter.  For each
species there then follows a set of distances to all the other species (options
allow the distance matrix to be upper or lower triangular or square).

     For example, here is a sample input matrix, with a square matrix:

     5
Alpha      0.000 1.000 2.000 3.000 3.000
Beta       1.000 0.000 2.000 3.000 3.000
Gamma      2.000 2.000 0.000 3.000 3.000
Delta      3.000 3.000 0.000 0.000 1.000
Epsilon    3.000 3.000 3.000 1.000 0.000


     In general the distances are assumed to all  be  present:  at  the  moment
there  is  only one way we can have missing entries in the distance matrix.  If
the S option (which allows the user to specify the  degree  of  replication  of
each  distance)  is  invoked,  with  some  of  the  entries  having  degree  of
replication zero, if the U (User Tree) option is in effect,  and  if  the  tree
being examined is such that every branch length can be estimated from the data,
it will be possible to solve for the branch lengths and  sum  of  squares  when
there  is some missing data.  You may not get away with this if the U option is
not in effect, as a tree may be tried on which the  program  will  calculate  a
branch length by dividing zero by zero, and get upset.

     The present version of NEIGHBOR does allow the Subreplication option to be
used  and the number of replicates to be in the input file, but it actally does
nothing with this information except read it in.  It makes use of  the  average
distances in the cells of the input data matrix. This means that you cannot use
the S option to treat zero cells.  We hope to modify NEIGHBOR in the future  to
allow  Subreplication.   Of course the U (User tree) option is not available in
NEIGHBOR in any case.

     The present versions of FITCH and KITSCH will do much  better  on  missing
values  than did previous versions, but you will still have to be careful about
them.  Nevertheless you might (just) be able to  explore  relevant  alternative
tree topologies one at a time using the U option when there is missing data.

     Alternatively, if the missing values in one cell always  correspond  to  a
cell  with  non-missing values on the opposite side of the main diagonal (i.e.,
if D(i,j) missing implies that D(j,i) is not missing), then use of the S option
will  always  be  sufficient to cope with missing values.  When it is used, the
missing distances should be entered as if present and the degree of replication
for them should be given as 0.

     Note that the algorithm for searching among topologies in FITCH and KITSCH
is  the  same  one  used  in  other  programs,  so  that it is necessary to try
different orders of species in the input data.  The J (Jumble) menu option  may
be sufficient for most purposes.

     The programs FITCH and KITSCH carry out the method of Fitch and Margoliash
(1967) for fitting trees to distance matrices.  They also are able to carry out
the least squares method of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967), plus  a  variety
of other methods of the same family (see the discussion of the P option below).


     The objective of these methods is to find that tree which minimizes

                                               2
                      __  __  n   ( D   - d   )
                      \   \    ij    ij    ij
  Sum of squares  =   /_  /_  ------------------
                       i   j           P
                                    D
                                     ij

(the symbol made up of \, / and _ characters is of  course  a  summation  sign)
where  D is the observed distance between species i and j and d is the expected
distance, computed as the sum of the lengths  (amounts  of  evolution)  of  the
segments of the tree from species i to species j.  The quantity n is the number
of times each distance has been replicated.  In simple cases this is  taken  to
be  one,  but the user can, as an option, specify the degree of replication for
each distance.  The distance is then assumed to be a mean of those  replicates.
The  power  P  is  what  distinguished  the  various  methods.   For the Fitch-
Margoliash method, which is the default method with this  program,  P  is  2.0.
For  the  Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards least squares method it should be set to 0
(so that the  denominator  is  always  1).   An  intermediate  method  is  also
available in which P is 1.0, and any other value of P, such as 4.0 or -2.3, can
also be used.  This generates a whole family of methods.

     The P (Power) option is not  available  in  the  Neighbor-Joining  program
NEIGHBOR.   Implicitly,  in  this  program P is 0.0 (though it is hard to prove
this).  The UPGMA option of NEIGHBOR will assign the same branch lengths to the
particular  tree topology that it finds as will KITSCH when given the same tree
and Power = 0.0.

     All these methods make  the  assumptions  of  additivity  and  independent
errors.   The  difference  between the methods is how they weight departures of
observed from expected.  In effect, these methods differ  in  how  they  assume
that  the  variance of measurement of a distance will rise as a function of the
expected value of the distance.

     These methods assume  that  the  variance  of  the  measurement  error  is
proportional to the P-th power of the expectation (hence the standard deviation
will be proportional to the P/2-th power of  the  expectation).   If  you  have
reason  to think that the measurement error of a distance is the same for small
distances as it is for large, then you should set P=0 and use the least squares
method, but if you have reason to think that the relative (percentage) error is
more nearly constant than the absolute error, you should use  P=2,  the  Fitch-
Margoliash  method.   In  between, P=1 would be appropriate if the sizes of the
errors were proportional to the square roots of the expected distance.


                                    OPTIONS

Here are the options available in all three programs.  They are selected  using
the menu of options.

          U   the User tree option.  As with other methods the user  trees  are
              provided  at  the  end of the file (see the general documentation
              file).  The trees in FITCH are  regarded  as  unrooted,  and  are
              specified  with  a  trifurcation (three-way split) at their base:
              e. g.:

              ((A,B),C,(D,E));

              while in KITSCH they are to be regarded  as  rooted  and  have  a


              bifurcation at the base:

              ((A,B),(C,(D,E)));

              Be careful not to move User trees from FITCH  to  KITSCH  without
              changing  their  form  appropriately  (you  can  use RETREE to do
              this).   User trees are not available in NEIGHBOR.  In  FITCH  if
              you  specify  the branch lengths on one or more branches, you can
              select the L (use branch Lengths) option to  avoid  having  those
              branches  iterated,  so  that  the  tree  is evaluated with their
              lengths fixed.

          P   indicates that you are going to set the Power  (P  in  the  above
              formula).   The default value is 2 (the Fitch-Margoliash method).
              The power, a real number such as 1.0,  is  prompted  for  by  the
              programs.  This option is not available in NEIGHBOR.

          -   indicates that negative segment lengths are to be allowed in  the
              tree   (default   is  to  require  that  all  branch  lengths  be
              nonnegative).  This option is not available in NEIGHBOR.

          O   is the usual Outgroup option, available in FITCH and NEIGHBOR but
              not in KITSCH, nor when the UPGMA option of NEIGHBOR is used.

          L   indicates that the distance matrix is input  in  Lower-triangular
              form  (the  lower-left  half of the distance matrix only, without
              the zero diagonal elements).

          R   indicates that the distance matrix is input  in  uppeR-triangular
              form  (the  upper-right half of the distance matrix only, without
              the zero diagonal elements).

          S   is the Subreplication option.  It informs the program that  after
              each  distance  will  be  provided an integer indicating that the
              distance is  a  mean  of  that  many  replicates.   There  is  no
              auxiliary information, but the presence of the S option indicates
              that the data will be in a different form.  Each distance must be
              followed  by  an  integer indicating the number of replicates, so
              that a line of data looks like this:

              Delta      3.00 5  3.21 3  1.84 9

              the 5, 3, and 9 being the number of  times  the  measurement  was
              replicated.   When  the  number of replicates is zero, a distance
              value must still be provided, although its vale  will  not  afect
              the result.  This option is not available in NEIGHBOR.

          G  is the usual Global branch-swapping option.  It  is  available  in
              FITCH and KITSCH but is not relevant to NEIGHBOR.

          J   indicates the usual J (Jumble) option for entering species  in  a
              random  order.  In FITCH and KITSCH if you do multiple jumbles in
              one run the program will print out the best tree found overall.

          M   is the usal Multiple data sets option, available in all of  these
              programs.  It allows us (when the output tree file is analyzed in
              CONSENSE) to do a bootstrap (or  delete-half-jackknife)  analysis
              with the distance matrix{ programs.

     The numerical options are the usual ones and  should  be  clear  from  the
menu.


     Note that when the options L or R are used one of the species,  the  first
or  last one, will have its name on an otherwise empty line.  Even so, the name
should be padded out to full length with  blanks.   Here  is  a  sample  lower-
triangular data set.

     5
Alpha             <--- note: five blanks should follow the name "Alpha"
Beta       1.00
Gamma      3.00 3.00
Delta      3.00 3.00 2.00
Epsilon    3.00 3.00 2.00 1.00

Be careful if you are using  lower-  or  upper-triangular  trees  to  make  the
corresponding  selection  from  the  menu  (L  or  R),  as the C version of the
programs may get horribly confused otherwise, BUT  STILL  GIVE  A  RESULT  even
though  it  is  then  meaningless.  With the menu option selected all should be
well.
