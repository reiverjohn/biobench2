            Gene Frequencies and Continuous Character Data Programs

     The programs in this group use gene frequencies and quantitative character
values.  One (CONTML) constructs maximum likelihood estimates of the phylogeny,
another (GENDIST) computes genetic distances for use  in  the  distance  matrix
programs,  and  the  third  (CONTRAST)  examines  correlation of traits as they
evolve along a given phylogeny.

     When the gene frequencies  data  are  used  in  CONTML  or  GENDIST,  this
involves the following assumptions:

     1. Different lineages evolve independently.

     2. After two lineages split, their characters change independently.

     3. Each gene frequency changes by genetic drift, with or without  mutation
(this varies from method to method).

     4. Different loci or characters drift independently.

How these assumptions affect the methods will be seen in my papers on inference
of  phylogenies from gene frequency and continuous character data (Felsenstein,
1973b, 1981c, 1985c).

     The input formats are fairly similar to the  discrete-character  programs,
but  with  one difference.  When CONTML is used in the gene-frequency mode (its
usual, default mode), or when GENDIST is used,  the  first  line  contains  the
number  of  species  (or  populations)  and  the number of loci and the options
information.  There then follows a line which gives the numbers of  alleles  at
each  locus, in order.  This must be the full number of alleles, not the number
of alleles which will be input: i. e. for a two-allele locus the number  should
be  2,  not  1.   There then follow the species (population) data, each species
beginning on a new line.  The first 10 characters are taken as  the  name,  and
thereafter  the  values  of  the  individual  characters  are read free-format,
preceded and separated by blanks.  They can go to a new line if desired, though
of  course  not  in  the  middle of a number.  Missing data is not allowed - an
important limitation.  In  the  default  configuration,  for  each  locus,  the
numbers  should  be  the  frequencies of all but one allele.  The menu option A
(All) signals that the frequencies of all alleles are  provided  in  the  input
data  --  the  program  will  then  automatically  ignore the last of them.  So
without the A option, for a three-allele locus there should be two numbers, the
frequencies  of  two  of  the alleles (and of course it must always be the same
two!).  Here is a typical data set without the A option:

     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.80 0.10 0.56
Beta       0.72 0.54 0.30 0.20
Gamma      0.38 0.10 0.05  0.98
Delta      0.42 0.40 0.43 0.97
Epsilon    0.10 0.30 0.70 0.62

whereas here is what it would have to look like if the A option were invoked:


     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.10 0.80 0.10 0.10 0.56 0.44
Beta       0.72 0.28 0.54 0.30 0.16 0.20 0.80
Gamma      0.38 0.62 0.10 0.05 0.85  0.98 0.02
Delta      0.42 0.58 0.40 0.43 0.17 0.97 0.03
Epsilon    0.10 0.90 0.30 0.70 0.00 0.62 0.38

While many compilers may be more tolerant, it is probably  wise  to  make  sure
that  each  number, including the first, is preceded by a blank, and that there
are digits both preceding and following any decimal points.

     CONTML and CONTRAST also treat quantitative  characters  (the  continuous-
characters  mode  in  CONTML,   which  is  option  C).  It is assumed that each
character is evolving according to a Brownian motion model, at the  same  rate,
and  independently.   In  reality  it  is almost always impossible to guarantee
this.  The issue is discussed at length in my review article in  Annual  Review
of  Ecology  and  Systematics  (1988a),  where  I  point  out the difficulty of
transforming the characters so that they are not only  genetically  independent
but  have independent selection acting on them.  If you are going to use CONTML
to model evolution of continuous characters, then you should at least make some
attempt  to remove genetic correlations between the characters (usually all one
can do is remove phenotypic correlations by transforming the characters so that
there  is  no  within-population  covariance  and so that the within-population
variances of the characters are equal -- this is equivalent to using  Canonical
Variates).   However,  this will only guarantee that one has removed phenotypic
covariances between characters.  Genetic covariances could only be  removed  by
knowing  the  coheritabilities  of  the characters, which would require genetic
experiments, and selective  covariances  (covariances  due  to  covariation  of
selection  pressures)  would  require  knowledge  of  the sources and extent of
selection pressure in all variables.

     CONTRAST is a program designed to infer, for a  given  phylogeny  that  is
provided  to  the  program,  the  covariation between characters in a data set.
Thus we have a program in this set that allow us to take information about  the
covariation  and  rates  of evolution of characters and make an estimate of the
phylogeny (CONTML), and a program that takes an estimate of the  phylogeny  and
infers  the variances and covariances of the character changes.  But we have no
program that infers both the phylogenies and the character covariation from the
same data set.

     In the quantitative characters mode, a typical small data set would be:

     5   6
Alpha      0.345 0.467 1.213  2.2  -1.2 1.0
Beta       0.457 0.444 1.1    1.987 -0.2 2.678
Gamma      0.6 0.12 0.97 2.3  -0.11 1.54
Delta      0.68  0.203 0.888 2.0  1.67
Epsilon    0.297  0.22 0.90 1.9 1.74

Note that in the latter case, there is no line giving the numbers of alleles at
each  locus.   In  this  latter  case  no  square-root  transformation  of  the
coordinates is done: each is assumed to  give  directly  the  position  on  the
Brownian motion scale.

     For further discussion of options  and  modifiable  constants  in  CONTML,
GENDIST, and CONTRAST see the documentation files for those programs.
