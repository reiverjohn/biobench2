    DNADIST -- Program to compute distance matrix from nucleotide sequences

     This program uses nucleotide sequences to compute a distance matrix, under
three  different models of nucleotide substitution.  The distance for each pair
of species estimates the total branch length between the two species,  and  can
be  used in the distance matrix programs FITCH, KITSCH or NEIGHBOR.  This is an
alternative to use of the  sequence  data  itself  in  the  maximum  likelihood
program DNAML or the parsimony program DNAPARS.

     The program reads in  nucleotide  sequences  and  writes  an  output  file
containing  the  distance  matrix.  The three models of nucleotide substitution
are those of Jukes and Cantor (1969), Kimura (1980) and a the model used in  my
maximum likelihood phylogeny program DNAML.  The modification of Kimura's model
to allow for unequal rates of substitution at different sites by  Jin  and  Nei
(1990)  is  also  available  as another variation.  The program correctly takes
into account a variety of sequence ambiguities, although in  cases  where  they
exist it can be slow.

     Jukes and Cantor's (1969) model assumes that there is  independent  change
at all sites, with equal probability.  Whether a base changes is independent of
its identity, and when it changes there is an equal probability  of  ending  up
with  each  of  the  other three bases.  Thus the transition probability matrix
(this is a technical term from probability theory and has nothing  to  do  with
transitions as opposed to transversions) for a short period of time dt is:

              To:    A        G        C        T
                   ---------------------------------
               A  | 1-3a      a         a       a
       From:   G  |  a       1-3a       a       a
               C  |  a        a        1-3a     a
               T  |  a        a         a      1-3a

where a is  u dt, the product of the rate of substitution per unit time (u) and
the  length  dt  of the time interval.  For longer periods of time this implies
that the probability that two sequences will differ at a given site is:

                                        - 4/3 u t
               p   =    3/4 ( 1   -    e           )

and hence that if we observe p, we can compute an estimate of the branch length
ut by inverting this to get

                ut   =   - 3/4 log  ( 1  -  4/3 p )
                                  e

The Kimura "2-parameter" model is almost as symmetric as this, but allows for a
difference   between   transition   and  transversion  rates.   Its  transition
probability matrix for a short interval of time is:







              To:     A        G        C        T
                   ---------------------------------
               A  | 1-a-2b     a         b       b
       From:   G  |   a      1-a-2b      b       b
               C  |   b        b       1-a-2b    a
               T  |   b        b         a     1-a-2b

where a is u dt, the product of the rate of transitions per unit time and dt is
the length dt of the time interval, and b is v dt, the product of half the rate
of transversions (i.e., the rate of a specific transversion) and the length  dt
of the time interval.

     The  third  model  used  is  a  model  incorporating  different  rates  of
transition and transversion, but also allowing for different frequencies of the
four nucleotides.  It is  the  model  which  is  used  in  DNAML,  the  maximum
likelihood  nucelotide  sequence phylogenies program in this package.  You will
find the model described in the document  for  that  program.   The  transition
probabilities for this model are also given by Kishino and Hasegawa (1989).

     The three models are closely related.  The DNAML model reduces to Kimura's
two-parameter  model  if we assume that the equilibrium frequencies of the four
bases are equal.  The Jukes-Cantor model in turn  is  a  special  case  of  the
Kimura 2-parameter model where a = b.  Thus each model is a special case of the
ones that follow it, Jukes-Cantor being a special case of both of the others.

     The Jin and Nei (1990) distance uses Kimura's model of base  substitution,
but assumes that the rate of substitution varies from site to site according to
a gamma distribution, with a coefficient of variation that is specified by  the
user.  The user is asked for it when choosing this option in the menu.

     Each distance that is calculated is an estimate, from that particular pair
of  species,  of the divergence time between those two species.  For the Jukes-
Cantor model, the estimate is computed using the formula for ut given above, as
long  as the nucleotide symbols in the two sequences are all either A, C, G, T,
U, N, X, ?, or - (the latter four indicate a deletion or an unknown nucleotide.
This  estimate is a maximum likelihood estimate for that model.  For the Kimura
2-parameter model, with only these nucleotide symbols, formulas special to that
estimate  are  also computed.  These are also, in effect, computing the maximum
likelihood estimate for that model.  In the  Kimura  case  it  depends  on  the
observed  sequences only through the sequence length and the observed number of
transition and transversion differences  between  those  two  sequences.    The
calculation  in  that  case  is  a  maximum likelihood estimate and will differ
somewhat from the estimate obtained from  the  formulas  in  Kimura's  original
paper.   That  formula  was  also  a  maximum likelihood estimate, but with the
transition/transversion ratio estimated empirically, separately for  each  pair
of  sequences.  In the present case, one overall preset transition/transversion
ratio is  used  which  makes  the  computations  harder  but  achieves  greater
consistency between different comparisons.

     For the DNAML model, or for any of the models where one or both  sequences
contain  at  least  one  of  the  other  ambiguity codons such as Y, R, etc., a
maximum likelihood calculation is also done using  code  which  was  originally
written  for  DNAML.   Its  disadvantage  is  that  it  is slow.  The resulting
distance is in effect a maximum likelihood estimate  of  the  diveregence  time
(total  branch  length between) the two sequences.  However the present program
will be much faster than versions earlier than 3.5, because I have  speeded  up
the iterations.

     Note that there is an  assumption  that  we  are  looking  at  all  sites,
including  those that have not changed at all.  It is important not to restrict
attention to some sites based on whether or not they have changed;  doing  that


would bias the distances by making them too large, and that in turn would cause
the distances to misinterpret the meaning of those sites that had changed.

     A major innovation in this program is that,  for  all  of  these  distance
methods,  the  program  allows us to specify that "third position" bases have a
different rate of substitution than first and second  positions,  that  introns
have  a  different rate than exons, and so on.  The Categories option allows us
to make up to 9 categories of sites and specify different rates of  change  for
them.  Note that this Categories option is different from the one used in DNAML
and DNAMLK where  you  do  not  have  to  specify  which  sites  are  in  which
categories.


                           INPUT FORMAT AND OPTIONS

     Input is fairly standard, with one addition.  As usual the first  line  of
the  file  gives  the number of species and the number of sites.  There follows
the characters C or W if the Categories or Weights options are being used.

     Next come the species data.  Each sequence starts on a  new  line,  has  a
ten-character  species  name  that  must  be blank-filled to be of that length,
followed immediately by the species data in the one-letter code.  The sequences
must  either  be  in the "interleaved" or "sequential" formats described in the
Molecular Sequence Programs document.  The I option selects between them.   The
sequences  can  have internal blanks in the sequence but there must be no extra
blanks at the end of the terminated line.  Note that a blank  is  not  a  valid
symbol for a deletion.

     After that are the lines (if any) containing the information  for  the  C,
and W options, as described below.

     The options are selected using an interactive menu.  The menu  looks  like
this:


Nucleic acid sequence Distance Matrix program, version 3.5c

Settings for this run:
  D  Distance (Kimura, Jin/Nei, ML, J-C)?  Kimura 2-parameter
  T        Transition/transversion ratio?  2.0
  C   One category of substitution rates?  Yes
  L              Form of distance matrix?  Square
  M           Analyze multiple data sets?  No
  I          Input sequences interleaved?  Yes
  0   Terminal type (IBM PC, VT52, ANSI)?  ANSI
  1    Print out the data at start of run  No
  2  Print indications of progress of run  Yes

Are these settings correct? (type Y or letter for one to change)

The user either types "Y" (followed, of course, by a  carriage-return)  if  the
settings  shown  are to be accepted, or the letter or digit corresponding to an
option that is to be changed.

     The options M and 0 are the usual ones.  They are described  in  the  main
documentation file of this package.  Option I is the same as in other molecular
sequence programs and is described in the documentation file for  the  sequence
programs.

     The D option selects one of the four distance methods.  It  toggles  among
the  three  methods. The default method, if none is specified, is the Kimura 2-


parameter model.  If the Nei/Jin distance is selected the user will be asked to
supply  the  coefficient  of variation of the rate of substitution among sites.
This is different from the parameters used by Nei and Jin but related to  them:
their parameters a are related to the coefficient of variation by

                         1/2
               CV = 1 / a
or
                            2
                a = 1 / (CV)

(their parameter b is absorbed here by the requirement that time is  scaled  so
that  the  mean  rate of evolution is 1 per unit time, which means that a = b).
As we consider cases in which the rates are  less  variable  we  should  set  a
larger and larger, as CV gets smaller and smaller.

     The F (Frequencies) option appears when the Maximum Likelihood distance is
selected.   This  distance  requires  that  the  program  be  provided with the
equilibrium frequencies of the four bases A, C, G, and T (or U).   Its  default
setting  is  one  which  may  save  users  much  time.   If you want to use the
empirical frequencies of the bases, observed in the  input  sequences,  as  the
base  frequencies,  you  simply use the default setting of the F option.  These
empirical frequencies are not really the maximum likelihood  estimates  of  the
base  frequencies,  but they will often be close to those values (what they are
is maximum likelihood estimates under a "star" or "explosion"  phylogeny).   If
you change the setting of the F option you will be prompted for the frequencies
of the four bases.  These must add to 1  and  are  to  be  typed  on  one  line
separated by blanks, not commas.

     The T option in this program does not stand for Threshold, but instead  is
the  Transition/transversion  option.   The  user is prompted for a real number
greater than 0.0, as the expected ratio of transitions to transversions.   Note
that  this is not the ratio of the first to the second kinds of events, but the
resulting  expected  ratio  of  transitions  to   transversions.    The   exact
relationship  between  these  two  quantities depends on the frequencies in the
base pools.  The default value of the T parameter if  you  do  not  use  the  T
option is 2.0.

     The C (Categories) option is the one which species the relative  rates  of
substitution  at  different  sites.   The  sites  are organized into up to nine
categories.  You are supposed to specify the relative rates of substitution  in
these  categories.  The category option asks you to specify how many categories
there are to be (up to a maximum of 9) and then to enter the relative rates  of
change  in  the  categories, as nonnegative real numbers typed on the same line
separated by blanks, not commas.  If you do not use the C option then there  is
in effect one category with rate 1.0.

     In addition to this line, use of  the  C  option  requires  one  piece  of
information,  which  associates  sites  with  categories.   That is one or more
lines, which are placed after the initial line of  the  input  file,  and  also
after  the  lines containing the Weights, if any, but before the sequences.  It
consists of a line whose first characters are ignored, until the maximum length
of  a  species  name  has  been reached (it is therefore convenient, if species
names are a maximum of ten characters as in the program as distributed, to  put
CATEGORIES  in  the  first ten characters of that line, just to remind yourself
what it is).  The line then contains single digits  (1  through  9)  indicating
which  category  each  site  is in.  The information can continue to a new line
anytime in the middle of these digits.  For example the line may read:

CATEGORIES 5555555555 5123123123 1231231231 2344444444 4441231235 5555



(that is an example imagining five categories for the  three  codon  positions,
intron  positions,  and  flanking sequence positions).  A site may in effect be
dropped from the analysis by placing it in a category which  has  an  extremely
high rate of expected change.

     The L option specifies that the output file is to have the distance matrix
in lower triangular form.

     The W (Weights) option is invoked in the usual way, with  only  weights  0
and  1 allowed.  It selects a set of sites to be analyzed, ignoring the others.
The sites selected are those with weight 1.  If the W option  is  not  invoked,
all sites are analyzed.


                                 OUTPUT FORMAT

     As the distances are computed,  the  program  prints  on  your  screen  or
terminal  the  names of the species in turn, followed by one dot (".") for each
other species for which the distance to that species has been  computed.   Thus
if  there  are  ten species, the first species name is printed out, followed by
nine dots, then on the next line the next species name is printed out  followed
by eight dots, then the next followed by seven dots, and so on.  The pattern of
dots should form a triangle.  When the distance matrix has been written out  to
the output file, the user is notified of that.

     The output file contains on its first line  the  number  of  species.  The
distance matrix is then printed in standard form, with each species starting on
a new line with the species name, followed by the distances to the  species  in
order.   These  continue  onto a new line after every nine distances.  If the L
option is used, the matrix or distances is in lower triangular  form,  so  that
only  the distances to the other species that precede each species are printed.
Otherwise the distance matrix is square with zero distances  on  the  diagonal.
In general the format of the distance matrix is such that it can serve as input
to any of the distance matrix programs.

     If the option to print out the data is  selected,  the  output  file  will
precede  the  data  by  more  complete  information  on  the input and the menu
selections.  The output file begins by giving the number  of  species  and  the
number  of  characters,  and the identity of the distance measure that is being
used.

     If the C (Categories) option is used a table  of  the  relative  rates  of
expected  substitution  at  each category of sites is printed, and a listing of
the categories each site is in.

     There will then follow the equilibrium frequencies of the four bases.   If
the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura distances are used, these will necessarily be 0.25 :
0.25 : 0.25 : 0.25.  The output then shows  the  transition/transversion  ratio
that  was  specified  or  used  by  default.   In  the case of the Jukes-Cantor
distance this will always be 0.5.  The  transition-transversion  parameter  (as
opposed  to the ratio) is also printed out: this is used within the program and
can be ignored.  There then follow the data sequences, with the base  sequences
printed in groups of ten bases along the lines of the Genbank and EMBL formats.

     The distances printed out are scaled  in  terms  of  expected  numbers  of
substitutions, counting both transitions and transversions but not replacements
of a base by itself, and scaled so that the average rate  of  change,  averaged
over  all  sites  analyzed,  is  set to 1.0 if there are multiple categories of
sites.  This means that whether or not there are multiple categories of  sites,
the  expected fraction of change for very small branches is equal to the branch
length.  Of course, when a branch is twice as long  this  does  not  mean  that


there  will  be  twice  as much net change expected along it, since some of the
changes may occur in the same site and overlie or even reverse each other.  The
branch  lengths  estimates here are in terms of the expected underlying numbers
of changes.  That means that a branch of length 0.26 is 26 times as long as one
which  would  show  a  1%  difference  between  the nucleotide sequences at the
beginning and end of the branch.  But we would not expect the sequences at  the
beginning  and  end  of  the branch to be 26% different, as there would be some
overlaying of changes.

     One problem that can arise is that two or more of the species  can  be  so
dissimilar  that  the  distance  between them would have to be infinite, as the
likelihood rises indefinitely as the estimated divergence time increases.   For
example,  with  the  Jukes-Cantor  model, if the two sequences differ in 75% or
more of their positions then the estimate of dovergence time would be infinite.
Since there is no way to represent an infinite distance in the output file, the
program regards this as an error, issues an error message indicating which pair
of  species  are  causing  the  problem,  and  stops.  It might be that, had it
continued running, it would have also run into  the  same  problem  with  other
pairs  of  species.  If the Kimura distance is being used there may be no error
message; the program may simply give a large distance value  (it  is  iterating
towards  infinity and the value is just where the iteration stopped).  Likewise
some maximum likelihood estimates may also become large  for  the  same  reason
(the  sequences  showing  more  divergence  than is expected even with infinite
branch length).  I hope in the future to add more warning messages  that  would
alert the user the this.


                               PROGRAM CONSTANTS

     The constants that are  available  to  be  changed  by  the  user  at  the
beginning  of  the  program include "maxcategories", the maximum number of site
categories, "iterations", which  controls  the  number  of  times  the  program
iterates  the  EM algorithm that is used to do the maximum likelihood distance,
"namelength", the length of species  names  in  characters,  and  "epsilon",  a
parameter  which  controls  the accuracy of the results of the iterations which
estimate the distances.  Making "epsilon" smaller will increase run  times  but
result in more decimal places of accuracy.  This should not be necessary.

     The program spends most of its time doing real arithmetic.   Any  software
or  hardware changes that speed up that arithmetic will speed it up by a nearly
proportional amount.  For example,  microcomputers  that  have  a  numeric  co-
processor  (such  as  an 8087, 80287, or 80387 chip) will run this program much
faster than ones that do not, if the software calls it.   The  algorithm,  with
separate  and independent computations occurring for each pattern, lends itself
readily to parallel processing.
